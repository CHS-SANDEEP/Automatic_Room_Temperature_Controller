# Automatic_Room_Temperature_Controller
 
Automatic temperature control system is an important
application used in almost all modern gadgets and smart homes. The
system for controlling temperature automatically is achieved by using
Arduino Uno-based microcontroller systems. Arduino Uno due to its
increased popularity finds its varied range of applications.Temperature
sensor TMP36 and Arduino Uno are the hardware used interfaced with a
computer, and the temperature is controlled in the room.
