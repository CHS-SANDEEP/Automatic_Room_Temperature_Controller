# Automatic_Room_Temperature_Controller
 
Weather changes become hard to adapt. That is, during
Winter we face difficulties tolerating the freezing cold, and that is why
people often prefer wearing coats during the season. On the other
hand, the weather becomes too warm in summer.So by using
Automatic temperature control system we can turn on fan at high
temperature and turn on heater at low temperature without any
physical touch/action.
